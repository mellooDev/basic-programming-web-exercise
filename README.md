# basic-programming-web-exercise
This is my programming web exercise. Actually, this website is not entirely my own,  but I feel quite happy to make a complete website for the first time. However, when the teacher answered me, I couldn't answer all the questions. I feel very sad because I haven't studied hard enough. I will try to study better to do more projects in the future
